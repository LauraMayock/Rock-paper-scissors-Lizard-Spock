# **_Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock - Portfolio Project 2 - HTML, CSS & Javascript_**
Created by the producers of the hit TV series The Big bang theory as a way for the 2 beloved charactors, Sheldon Cooper and Rajesh Koothrappali to settle a dispute about what to watch on TV. Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock is a fun twist on the old game of two people using only your hands and some simple rules.

# User Experience (UX)

## Target Audience
* With its straightforward rules and clear messaging, this game will be accessible to everyone but will be a favourite for those fans of the hit TV show that originated "The big bang theory".


## First time user
As a first-time visitor, I want a clear understanding of the purpose of the page and the ability to use it intuitively with its clear and thought-out design. Although the rules are laid out in the help section, I can delve right in and learn while playing as the deciding factor of each round is displayed.

## Return user
As a returning user, I can enjoy the game on the go or in my leisure time as a fun way to pass the time.

## Site Aims
 * To provide the user with a game that is easy to understand and play. 
 * To offer information on the rules clearly and concisely. 


## Design Wireframes
The innitial goals and scope of the website were worked on and planned using figma. The sturctue and scope of the website differs from the initial planning as i deemed it important to initially approach the project considering all possible feature that would be benificial for both the customer and the user. This provide a good basis for a minimum viable product as well as future add ons. 

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/tp0fcpf/Figma.png" alt="Figma project 2 brainstorm">Hero image</a>

Wireframes were created using Balsamiq:

</details>

## Site Stucture

Consisting of one page, the site has a simple layout. A modal at the top left corner provides a quick outline of the rules. This makes it very convenient to play on the go. 

## Design Choices

The simple design makes it user-friendly for all ages and very accessible. To ensure this, I tried to meet as much of the criteria laid out by devtool lighthouse testing. 

### Imagery

I used the connection with the popular TV series to make the site appealing to their broad fan base. The image was sourced from [Clip art Key](https://www.clipartkey.com/). Because of the imagery chosen, the game is best enjoyed using a portrait view. 
 
 <img src="https://i.ibb.co/pvc2bP2/Clipart-Key-2855975-1.png" alt="Hero image of big bang Theory charactors"></a>
 

### Colour scheme

My final choice of colours was chosen to ompliment the hero image. A selection of Teal Green, and white. As the green was an intense colour, I knew they were a great choice of colour for contrasting, ensuring the eligibility of text and sticking with the theme of simplicity.

### Typography

I chose two fonts from the google font gallery. Comfortaa for the main text and Patua One for the information in the footer and the font on the contactus form. I did try a few options to highlight the quote below the hero video but decided against it as it was too jarring. I chose Arial as the font family to fall back on for Comfortaa as it would still fit in with the feel of the page. And the font Georgia as a fallback for Patua One.

# Features

## Navigation

* The navigation menu is positioned at the top of each page and gives the user easy access to the main areas of the website.
* The logo, which is also prominent on each page, gives an easy link back to the main page.
* The navigational link to the Pre-booking form is purposely placed within the advertisements, which are solely related to the event organised by the mother and baby group.
* This is to ensure minimum confusion for the user of the site.
* To ensure eligibility and easy use, the navigation bar converts from a row of navigation buttons at the top of the page to a row nestled beneath the logo on smaller screens.

* Each navigation link has a hover element as a visual add for the user. 

## Home Page

* As it is the landing page, it needed to appeal to the eye and striking. I wanted it to be memorable and unique but in keeping with the tone of the page. As the users lifesytles are busy, it is vital that the user immediately know they are on the correct website at a glance.
* For the larger screens, the hero video is falling a bit below the screen; this intuitively nudges the user to scroll down. On the smaller screens, you can see the opening heading which, as well as the hero video, is purposely chosen to connect with the user.

Landing page small screen



* The main text area gives a quick overview of what to expect at each meeting. It provides critical information to alleviate user concerns by pointing out who the group facilitates and the amenities available to them and their child. 

* The Weekly meet up section gives a day, time and google link to the location of each of the meetups. Again the simple prominent design was purposely done for a user on the go. 

* The Testimonials section is also a key element in encouraging anxious new parents that the Westport mother and baby group is perfect for them. It helps lay the foundation of trust and kinship with the user by providing testimonials from users to relate to.

* Each element on this page has the first time user, the new parent eager to connect with their local community, and the returning user looking to find the information required quickly.



## Events Page

* The events pages provide up to date information on events organised by the Mother and baby ground and the community. This gives parents and carers a one-stop destination to find events, courses and family fun in their area. Ensuring return users to the website and a continued connection with families that have moved on from baby/toddler-aged children. 

* There are visuals for the user via photos of the events and a video with controls to give the user full control of its workings.

* The events section also links a pre-booking from within the website (pre-booking-form.html). The user can pre-book their chosen event, and the organisers can gauge popularity in the event and plan accordingly.

* I have purposely chosen to leave the link to the prebooking form blue and underlined; this is for easy recognition.

## Pre-Booking Page

* The form is quick to fill in and ensures that the required information is filled out in the correct fields.

# Future Features

* It would be very beneficial to upgrade the pre-booking page to a booking page. This would be beneficial for bothering the user and the customer.

* A resources section with access to local resources such as a list of local doctors, healthcare professions, and local amenities. This would be a great added benefit for first-time users and ensure returning users.

* A blog section would help keep users up to date with local news and keep users engaged.

* An online form would be such a benefit for users to connect with others in the area.
